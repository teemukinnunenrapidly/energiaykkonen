## Task Management with Task Master

This project uses [Task Master](https://github.com/eyaltoledano/claude-task-master) for AI-powered task management and project planning.

### Setup

1. **MCP Configuration**: The project is configured with MCP (Model Control Protocol) for seamless integration with AI assistants.

2. **Task Master**: Initialize and manage tasks using the Task Master AI tools.

3. **PRD**: Create a Product Requirements Document in `.taskmaster/docs/prd.txt` to generate initial tasks.

### Getting Started

1. Create your PRD using the template in `.taskmaster/templates/example_prd.txt`
2. Parse your PRD to generate tasks: `Can you parse my PRD at .taskmaster/docs/prd.txt?`
3. View and manage tasks through your AI assistant
