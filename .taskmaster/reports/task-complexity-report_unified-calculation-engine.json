			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize UnifiedCalculationEngine Project Structure",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the project initialization into: (1) Monorepo tool selection and setup (Nx, Turborepo, or Yarn workspaces), (2) Directory and package structure definition (apps, packages, shared), (3) TypeScript configuration with project references and composite builds, (4) Path aliasing and module resolution setup, (5) Sample package/module creation and integration, (6) Initial build/test pipeline setup.",
			"reasoning": "Setting up a scalable TypeScript monorepo with project references, path aliases, and modular structure is moderately complex, requiring careful configuration and alignment with best practices for maintainability and developer experience. Each configuration step is distinct and critical for long-term scalability.[1][2][3][4][5]"

		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Unified Processing Pipeline",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) UnifiedCalculationEngine class scaffolding, (2) process() method interface and generics, (3) Stateless dependency injection (Supabase client, sessionId), (4) Integration of dependency extraction and evaluation pipeline, (5) Comprehensive unit test suite for all content types.",
			"reasoning": "Designing a unified, type-safe processing pipeline that handles multiple content types and is stateless except for injected dependencies is complex, requiring architectural clarity, robust typing, and thorough test coverage."

		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Develop Unified Dependency Extraction Logic",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 4,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: (1) Regex pattern design and validation, (2) Implementation of extractDependencies method, (3) Edge case and nested pattern handling, (4) Unit tests for extraction accuracy and robustness.",
			"reasoning": "While regex-based extraction is a common pattern, ensuring correctness for all edge cases and nested patterns adds moderate complexity, especially with the need for comprehensive testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Unified In-Memory Cache and Persistence Layer",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) In-memory cache (Map) implementation, (2) Supabase table schema definition and migration, (3) Persistence method with upsert logic, (4) Debounced write mechanism, (5) Integration and concurrency tests.",
			"reasoning": "Combining in-memory caching with robust, debounced persistence to a cloud database (Supabase) and ensuring consistency under concurrency is a multi-faceted challenge requiring careful design and testing."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Standardize Type Handling and Metadata",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 3,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: (1) determineType function implementation, (2) Refactor pipeline to remove type-based routing, (3) Type-safe metadata tagging and discriminated union integration.",
			"reasoning": "Refactoring type handling to metadata-only is straightforward but requires careful updates to ensure uniform processing and type safety throughout the pipeline."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Iterative Dependency Resolution Engine",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Queue-based dependency resolution design, (2) Batch processing logic and configuration, (3) Depth limit enforcement, (4) Async concurrency handling, (5) Tests for deep nesting and cyclic dependencies.",
			"reasoning": "Replacing recursion with an iterative, queue-based approach for dependency resolution—while ensuring performance, correctness, and safety against cycles or overflows—is architecturally complex and critical for scalability."

		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Migrate Existing Data and Update Consumers",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: (1) Data migration script development, (2) Schema validation and data integrity checks, (3) Consumer code refactoring to new API, (4) Removal of legacy logic, (5) Backward compatibility layer (if needed), (6) Staging migration and rollback plan.",
			"reasoning": "Data migration and consumer refactoring involve significant risk and coordination, requiring careful planning, validation, and rollback strategies to ensure a smooth transition."

			"taskTitle": "Performance Optimization and Testing",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: (1) Debounced cache-to-DB write optimization, (2) Batch processing and parallelism profiling, (3) Worker thread or Promise.all integration, (4) Supabase query/index tuning, (5) Load and stress testing with monitoring.",
			"reasoning": "Performance optimization is iterative and multi-dimensional, involving both code-level and infrastructure-level improvements, as well as rigorous benchmarking and monitoring."
