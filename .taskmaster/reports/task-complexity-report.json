			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Implement WordPress iFrame Embed and Public Subdomain",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task into: Vercel subdomain configuration, DNS setup, SSL verification, iFrame embed code generation, dynamic resizing script development, WordPress compatibility testing, documentation, and troubleshooting guide.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves cross-platform integration (Vercel, DNS, WordPress), security header adjustments, and dynamic resizing logic. While each step is individually straightforward, the combination introduces moderate complexity due to cross-origin concerns, responsive design, and the need for robust documentation and testing. Industry best practices recommend explicit separation of deployment, embed code, script development, and integration testing for maintainability and reliability."

		{
			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "Final Deployment and Client Feedback",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: production deployment, live environment smoke testing, client review and feedback collection, implementation of last-minute adjustments, and final success metrics verification.",
			"reasoning": "Final deployment is a standard release management activity, but client feedback and last-minute changes can introduce unpredictability. The complexity is moderate, primarily due to coordination and the need for rapid iteration. Best practices suggest separating deployment, testing, feedback, fixes, and metrics validation to ensure a smooth go-live process."

			"taskId": 16,
			"taskTitle": "Update Form Layout to Scrollable Design with Finnish Language Support",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: form layout refactor, Finnish translation implementation, sequential completion logic, visual status indicators, responsive design, validation updates, smooth scrolling, accessibility enhancements, component dependency updates, and submit button logic.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires significant UI/UX refactoring, localization, accessibility, and logic changes. Maintaining sequential completion in a scrollable layout increases complexity, as does ensuring responsive and accessible design. Industry standards recommend granular subtasks for layout, localization, logic, accessibility, and validation to manage risk and ensure quality."

		{
			"taskId": 17,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Modern Tesla-Style UI with Split-Screen Layout",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 12,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: split-screen layout implementation, responsive grid system, 3D visualization panel, scrollable multi-section form, progressive unlocking logic, Intersection Observer-based scrolling, dynamic visualization updates, Tesla-style animations, mobile optimization, accessibility, skeleton loading states, and micro-interactions.",
			"reasoning": "This is a high-complexity UI overhaul involving advanced layout, animation, visualization, and accessibility requirements. The split-screen, progressive unlocking, and dynamic visual updates require careful state management and responsive design. Best practices dictate detailed breakdowns for layout, visualization, form logic, animation, accessibility, and performance optimization."

		{
			"taskId": 18,
			"taskTitle": "Build Brand Customization System for Calculator in Admin Panel",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 14,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: theme presets system, color customization controls, typography options, layout and spacing controls, component-specific styling panels, live preview system, device preview modes, theme import/export, A/B testing support, brand asset management, undo/redo system, accessibility validation tools, CSS variable generation, and persistence logic.",
			"reasoning": "This task is highly complex due to the breadth of customization features, live preview requirements, import/export, A/B testing, accessibility validation, and persistence. It touches multiple domains (UI, UX, data management, accessibility, performance) and requires robust architecture. Industry standards recommend extensive decomposition to manage risk, ensure maintainability, and facilitate iterative delivery."
