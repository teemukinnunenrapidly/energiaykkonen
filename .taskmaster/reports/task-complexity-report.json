			"taskTitle": "Update Form Layout to Scrollable Design with Finnish Language Support",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the remaining work into subtasks for: responsive layout refactoring, 3D visualization integration, accessibility enhancements, advanced validation updates, cross-browser QA, Finnish translation QA, visual indicator design, smooth scrolling UX improvements, dependency updates for related components, and documentation updates.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves significant UI/UX refactoring, localization, accessibility, and integration with existing components. The need to maintain sequential logic, responsive design, and accessibility adds technical and cognitive complexity. Industry best practices recommend decomposing such tasks into focused subtasks for layout, localization QA, accessibility, validation, and integration to manage risk and ensure maintainability[2][5]."

			"taskId": 18,
			"taskTitle": "Build Brand Customization System for Calculator in Admin Panel",
			"complexityScore": 9,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 15,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into subtasks for: theme presets architecture, color controls, typography controls, layout/spacing controls, component styling panels, live preview system, device preview modes, theme import/export, A/B testing integration, brand asset management, undo/redo logic, accessibility validation tools, CSS variable generation, persistence logic, backend API integration, and comprehensive QA.",
			"reasoning": "This task is architecturally complex, requiring modular UI design, real-time preview, data persistence, import/export, accessibility, and integration with analytics and asset management. Each customization dimension (color, typography, layout, components) is a distinct technical challenge. Best practices and industry standards (e.g., WBS, 8/80 rule) suggest granular decomposition to manage dependencies, facilitate parallel development, and ensure robust testing[2][5]."
