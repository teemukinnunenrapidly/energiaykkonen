			"taskId": 11,
			"taskTitle": "Implement WordPress iFrame Embed and Public Subdomain",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the task into: Vercel subdomain configuration, DNS setup, iFrame embed code generation, dynamic resizing script development, WordPress compatibility testing, and documentation for integration and troubleshooting.",
			"reasoning": "This task involves standard deployment and integration patterns (Vercel, DNS, iFrame, WordPress), but requires careful handling of cross-origin issues, responsive design, and dynamic resizing. Each step is well-defined but must be validated in a real-world WordPress environment. Industry best practices recommend separating deployment, embed code generation, script development, and testing for maintainability and traceability.[4]"

		{
			"taskId": 15,
			"taskTitle": "Final Deployment and Client Feedback",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: production deployment, smoke testing, client review and feedback collection, minor adjustments, success metrics validation, foundational system verification, and final go-live checklist.",
			"reasoning": "Final deployment is moderately complex due to the need for coordination, validation across multiple systems, and rapid response to client feedback. It requires both technical and stakeholder management subtasks. Best practices suggest decomposing into deployment, validation, feedback, and checklist steps to ensure nothing is missed and to facilitate rapid iteration.[4]"

			"taskId": 16,
			"taskTitle": "Update Form Layout to Scrollable Design with Finnish Language Support",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: form layout refactor, Finnish translation implementation, sequential completion logic, visual indicators, smooth scrolling, accessibility features, responsive design, and validation updates.",
			"reasoning": "This task requires significant UI/UX refactoring, localization, accessibility, and responsive design work. Maintaining sequential logic in a scrollable layout adds complexity, and accessibility is a non-trivial requirement. Industry standards recommend breaking out localization, accessibility, and layout changes for focused implementation and testing.[4]"
		},
		{
			"taskId": 17,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Modern Tesla-Style UI with Split-Screen Layout",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: responsive layout implementation, form section styling, form renderer integration, UI polish, performance optimization, accessibility testing, and design system compliance.",
			"reasoning": "Modern UI implementation with split-screen layout, responsive design, and integration with a shared schema and i18n setup is moderately complex. It requires coordination between design, development, and accessibility, with performance and usability as key concerns. Decomposition into layout, styling, integration, and optimization aligns with best practices for scalable UI development.[4]"

		{
			"taskId": 18,
			"taskTitle": "Build Brand Customization System for Calculator in Admin Panel",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: theme presets system, color customization, typography controls, layout and spacing controls, live preview, import/export functionality, logo upload, and accessibility validation.",
			"reasoning": "Brand customization involves multiple UI controls, live preview, asset management, and accessibility validation. While each feature is individually straightforward, their integration and persistence add moderate complexity. Industry standards recommend modularizing each customization aspect for maintainability and extensibility.[4]"
		},
		{
			"taskId": 19,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Admin Panel Preview Page for Calculator",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: admin route and navigation setup, calculator rendering with admin context, preview mode safety features, interactive preview controls, full calculator functionality validation, and responsive testing.",
			"reasoning": "Preview page implementation requires secure routing, rendering complex UI in admin context, and ensuring functional parity with the public calculator. Safety features and responsive controls add complexity. Best practices suggest separating navigation, rendering, controls, and validation for robust implementation.[4]"

		{
			"taskId": 20,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Comprehensive Calculations Page in Admin Panel",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: route and navigation setup, formula management system, shortcode generation, security measures, database schema design, UI for formula management, text-based formula editor, and preview integration.",
			"reasoning": "Calculation management involves backend schema, formula validation, UI/UX for editing, security, and integration with other admin features. The need for safe formula execution and preview integration increases complexity. Decomposition into backend, UI, security, and integration subtasks follows industry standards for admin tool development.[4]"

		{
			"taskId": 21,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Form Builder Page with Visual Content System in Admin Panel",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 9,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into: UI shell setup, drag-and-drop field management, properties panel, image management, preview/testing tools, import/export functionality, responsive design, accessibility, and Supabase schema integration.",
			"reasoning": "Form builder development is complex due to interactive drag-and-drop UI, field property editing, image management, preview/testing, and backend integration. Accessibility and responsive design further increase complexity. Industry best practices recommend modularizing each major feature for maintainability and extensibility.[4]"

		{
			"taskId": 22,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Test Email Functionality in Admin Preview Page",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Decompose into: test email toggle and visual indicators, dedicated API endpoint, email delivery logic modification, test submission database handling and cleanup, UI feedback for test actions, and security validation.",
			"reasoning": "Test email functionality requires UI changes, backend API development, email logic modification, database handling, and security validation. Each aspect is distinct and should be implemented and tested separately for reliability and maintainability.[4]"
		},
		{
			"taskId": 23,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Email Template Editor in Admin Panel",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Expand into: route and navigation setup, template editor UI, shortcode system, logo and branding controls, color and formatting options, template saving and versioning, preview and test email functionality, and import/export features.",
			"reasoning": "Email template editing involves rich text editing, shortcode management, branding, preview, and integration with email delivery. Versioning and import/export add further complexity. Decomposition into editor, branding, preview, and integration subtasks aligns with best practices for admin tool development.[4]"
