# Task ID: 10
# Title: Enable Analytics and Drop-off Tracking
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 9
# Priority: medium
# Description: Integrate Vercel Analytics and custom event tracking for form completion, drop-off, and device usage.
# Details:
- Add Vercel Analytics SDK and configure for subdomain.
- Track key events: form start, step completion, form submit, drop-off, device type.
- Store analytics events in Supabase or Vercel Analytics as appropriate.
- Visualize most common configurations and drop-off points in admin panel (basic).

# Test Strategy:
Check analytics dashboard for event data. Simulate user flows and verify events are tracked. Confirm device usage and drop-off points are recorded.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Integrate Vercel Analytics SDK [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Install and configure the Vercel Analytics SDK for the designated subdomain, ensuring analytics routes are enabled and the Analytics component is added to the root layout.
### Details:
Follow Vercel documentation to enable analytics in the dashboard, install @vercel/analytics, and add the Analytics component to the root layout. Deploy to Vercel and verify analytics requests are being sent.

Vercel Analytics SDK integration completed successfully:

âœ… **Package Installation**: Successfully installed @vercel/analytics
âœ… **Root Layout Integration**: Added Analytics component to src/app/layout.tsx for automatic page view and Core Web Vitals tracking
âœ… **Comprehensive Analytics Framework**: Created src/lib/analytics.ts with:
  - Device type detection (mobile/tablet/desktop)
  - Session ID tracking
  - Unified event tracking interface
  - Automatic Vercel Analytics integration
  - Supabase storage for detailed analytics

âœ… **Analytics API Endpoint**: Created src/app/api/analytics/route.ts for:
  - POST: Store detailed analytics events in Supabase
  - GET: Query analytics data with filtering capabilities
  - Proper error handling and validation

âœ… **Supabase Migration**: Created 03_create_analytics_table.sql with:
  - analytics_events table with proper constraints and indexes
  - Analytics aggregation views (daily summary, form funnel, device breakdown)
  - Data retention/cleanup functions
  - Performance optimized queries

âœ… **Form Integration**: Enhanced MultiStepForm.tsx with comprehensive tracking:
  - Form start/completion tracking
  - Step-by-step progression analytics
  - Abandonment detection (30+ second threshold)
  - Error tracking and validation failures
  - Calculation completion metrics
  - Device and session correlation

ðŸŽ¯ **Analytics Events Tracked**:
- page_view, form_started, step_completed, step_error
- form_submitted, form_abandoned, calculation_completed
- email_requested, lead_converted, error_occurred

ðŸ“Š **Data Collection**: Events sent to both Vercel Analytics (high-level) and Supabase (detailed analysis) with automatic device detection, session tracking, and performance metrics.

Integration is production-ready and follows best practices for privacy and performance.

## 2. Implement Custom Event Tracking [done]
### Dependencies: 10.1
### Description: Develop logic to track key events such as form start, step completion, form submit, drop-off, and device type throughout the multi-step form flow.
### Details:
Instrument the form with event triggers for each key interaction. Ensure device type is detected and included in event payloads. Use appropriate hooks or middleware to capture drop-off events.

## 3. Configure Analytics Event Storage [done]
### Dependencies: 10.2
### Description: Set up storage for analytics events, routing them to Supabase or Vercel Analytics as appropriate based on event type and usage requirements.
### Details:
Define which events are stored in Supabase versus Vercel Analytics. Implement API routes or direct SDK calls to persist event data. Ensure data integrity and security for stored analytics.

## 4. Visualize Analytics in Admin Panel [done]
### Dependencies: 10.3
### Description: Create basic visualizations in the admin panel to display the most common form configurations and drop-off points using the stored analytics data.
### Details:
Query analytics data from Supabase and/or Vercel Analytics. Build charts or tables to show configuration frequency and drop-off analysis. Integrate these visualizations into the admin panel UI.
