# Task ID: 5
# Title: Develop Calculation Engine
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement the calculation logic as a pure TypeScript module, matching the PRD's formulas and handling all edge cases.
# Details:
- Create `/lib/calculations.ts` with exported functions for each calculation (energy need, savings, payback, CO2, etc.).
- Accept form data as input and return all calculated outputs.
- Write unit tests for calculation accuracy (Jest or Vitest).
- Ensure calculations handle missing/optional fields gracefully.

# Test Strategy:
Run unit tests with sample inputs and verify outputs match PRD formulas. Cross-check with manual calculations for accuracy.
