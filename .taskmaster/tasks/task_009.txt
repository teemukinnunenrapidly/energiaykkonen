# Task ID: 9
# Title: Develop Simple Admin Panel (/admin)
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 7
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a password-protected admin panel for lead management, CSV export, and basic statistics.
# Details:
- Implement `/admin/page.tsx` route.
- Add login form (password from env variable, no user accounts).
- Display searchable/filterable leads table (fetch from Supabase).
- Add CSV export button (client-side CSV generation).
- Show basic stats: leads per day/week/month.
- Protect all admin routes with server-side auth middleware.

# Test Strategy:
Attempt access without password (should fail). Log in and verify all features work. Export CSV and check file integrity. Test stats accuracy.

# Subtasks:
## 1. Set Up /admin Route and Authentication Middleware [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Implement the `/admin/page.tsx` route and protect it with server-side authentication middleware using a password from an environment variable. Ensure all admin routes are inaccessible without authentication.
### Details:
Create the route file, add a login form, and configure middleware to check the password before granting access. No user accounts are needed; only a single password from the environment variable is required.

# Authentication Flow Implementation Plan

1. **Authentication Flow Architecture:**
   - Simple password-based login (no user accounts, just ADMIN_PASSWORD env var)
   - HttpOnly cookies for session management (secure and SSR-friendly)
   - Server-side middleware for route protection
   - Session verification in server actions and API routes

2. **Technical Implementation:**
   - Create middleware.ts for initial route protection on `/admin/*` routes
   - Add login form at `/admin/login` 
   - Implement session management with secure cookies
   - Server-side password verification against ADMIN_PASSWORD env var
   - Redirect logic for authenticated/unauthenticated users

3. **Files to Create/Modify:**
   - `middleware.ts` (root level) - Route protection
   - `src/app/admin/login/page.tsx` - Login form
   - `src/app/api/admin/auth/route.ts` - Authentication endpoint
   - `src/lib/auth.ts` - Session utilities
   - Update `src/app/admin/page.tsx` - Main admin panel (protected)

4. **Security Considerations:**
   - HttpOnly, secure cookies with proper SameSite settings
   - Session expiration (8 hours sliding window)
   - Rate limiting on login attempts
   - Server-side verification on all admin operations
   - Proper error handling without information leakage
