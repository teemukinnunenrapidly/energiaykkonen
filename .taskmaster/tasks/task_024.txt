# Task ID: 24
# Title: Implement Unified Form System Foundation
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 7, 9, 18
# Priority: critical
# Description: Create a simple, lightweight form schema that provides basic validation and structure for the calculator, focusing on essential functionality rather than building a complex unified system.
# Details:
1. Leverage existing TypeScript-based form schema architecture:
   - Use the already implemented Zod schema system for basic form field types and validation rules
   - Keep the existing TypeScript interfaces for form fields, sections, and pages
   - Focus on essential metadata support for basic styling
   - Utilize existing utility functions for schema validation and serialization/deserialization

2. Simplify visual content approach:
   - Use basic styling components rather than a complex unified asset management system
   - Implement simple responsive containers for consistent layout across device sizes
   - Apply minimal styling that meets the calculator's needs
   - Focus on functional components rather than complex visual infrastructure

3. Minimize animation requirements:
   - Implement only essential UI feedback animations
   - Use simple CSS transitions for basic interactions
   - Skip complex animation framework implementation
   - Ensure basic usability without elaborate transitions

4. Simplify internationalization approach:
   - Use existing Finnish translations without implementing a complex i18n system
   - Structure content in a way that can be easily translated later if needed
   - Focus on getting the calculator working in Finnish first

5. Create lightweight integration layer:
   - Implement basic adapters to connect the form schema with React Hook Form
   - Create simple hooks for form state management
   - Focus on essential event handling for calculator functionality
   - Keep the implementation straightforward and focused on immediate needs

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit testing:
   - Test the schema validation system with essential field types and validation rules
   - Verify basic form functionality works correctly
   - Focus on testing critical user paths and validation logic

2. Integration testing:
   - Test the integration between form schema and React Hook Form
   - Verify data flow between components works correctly
   - Ensure form submission and validation function as expected

3. Visual testing:
   - Manually verify that forms render correctly across different devices
   - Test basic responsive behavior on mobile, tablet, and desktop
   - Ensure the calculator is visually functional and usable

4. Performance testing:
   - Verify the calculator loads and operates efficiently
   - Ensure form validation doesn't cause performance issues

5. Documentation:
   - Create basic documentation for the form schema implementation
   - Include examples of how to use the form system in the calculator
   - Document any known limitations or future enhancement opportunities
