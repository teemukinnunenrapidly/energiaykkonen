# Task ID: 16
# Title: Update Form Layout to Scrollable Design with Finnish Language Support
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 6
# Priority: medium
# Description: Convert the multi-step form to a scrollable design with Finnish language labels, showing all four sections simultaneously while maintaining sequential completion requirements.
# Details:
- Refactor the existing form layout to display all sections in a single scrollable container
- Implement Finnish language labels for all form sections and fields:
  * Property questions (Kiinteistön tiedot)
  * Current heating (Nykyinen lämmitys)
  * Current heating costs (Lämmityskustannukset)
  * Check how much you'd save (Katso paljonko säästäisit)
- Restructure the page layout to show 3D visualization on the left side and the scrollable form on the right sidebar
- Maintain the sequential completion logic so users must complete each section in order to proceed
- Add visual indicators to show which sections are completed, active, or locked
- Ensure the form maintains responsive behavior on all screen sizes
- Update form validation to work with the new scrollable layout
- Implement smooth scrolling between sections when users complete a section
- Add accessibility features for the new layout (keyboard navigation, focus management)
- Update any related components that depend on the multi-step form structure
- Add Finnish completion status indicators ("✓ Valmis") for completed sections
- Implement submit button validation to ensure all sections are completed before submission

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify all form sections display correctly in the scrollable container with proper Finnish translations
2. Test the sequential completion logic by attempting to interact with locked sections
3. Confirm smooth scrolling behavior when advancing between sections
4. Test responsive behavior across mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports
5. Verify the 3D visualization and form sidebar layout works correctly on all screen sizes
6. Conduct accessibility testing with screen readers and keyboard navigation
7. Test form validation in the new layout with both valid and invalid inputs
8. Verify that all form data is still correctly collected and processed
9. Test with Finnish language users to ensure translations are accurate and natural
10. Perform cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge) to ensure consistent behavior
11. Verify section status tracking (completed, active, locked) works correctly with appropriate visual feedback
12. Test progress indicators at the top of the form to ensure they accurately reflect completion status
13. Confirm Finnish completion status indicators ("✓ Valmis") display correctly for completed sections
14. Verify submit button remains disabled until all sections are completed

The scrollable container for all form sections has been successfully implemented in our Tesla-style redesign. The form now displays all 5 sections in a single scrollable container with proper sequential completion logic, Finnish language support, and visual indicators for section status. The scrollable container maintains the progressive unlocking requirements while providing a smooth user experience.

Completed Finnish translations for all form components including PropertyDetailsStep, CurrentHeatingStep, BasicInfoStep, and ResultsStep. All form elements are now fully localized in Finnish, including labels, placeholders, error messages, section titles, help text, and UI elements. The implementation provides users with a complete Finnish language experience throughout the entire form interface.

Successfully implemented enhanced smooth scrolling functionality with the following features:

1) Enhanced scrollToSection function with configurable options and visual feedback
2) Improved auto-scroll timing (500ms delay for better UX)
3) Keyboard navigation support (Arrow keys, Page Up/Down, Home, End)
4) Touch/swipe support for mobile devices
5) Enhanced scrollbar styling with custom CSS
6) Visual feedback animation during scrolling
7) iOS-specific smooth scrolling support

The form now provides a premium Tesla-style scrolling experience with multiple navigation methods.

## 6. Restructure page layout with 3D visualization and form sidebar [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Update the page layout to show the 3D visualization on the left side and the scrollable form on the right sidebar.
### Details:
<info added on 2025-08-25T09:21:47.795Z>
The layout should be restructured to display static images and illustrations related to energy on the left side of the page, with the scrollable form positioned on the right sidebar. This replaces the previously planned 3D visualization approach while maintaining the same overall layout concept of visual content on the left and interactive form elements on the right.
