# Task ID: 25
# Title: Implement Visual Content System for Form UI
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 24, 17, 18
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create a simple image management system that provides basic visual support for the calculator forms, enhancing the Tesla-style UI across both the customer-facing calculator and admin interfaces.
# Details:
1. Create a core visual content architecture:
   - Develop a simple TypeScript-based system for managing visual assets
   - Implement a basic store for SVG illustrations and static images
   - Design minimal interfaces for basic visual content types
   - Build essential utility functions for loading and rendering visual content

2. Implement basic transitions:
   - Create simple CSS transition components
   - Implement basic enter/exit transitions for form sections
   - Ensure transitions respect reduced motion preferences for accessibility
   - Focus on practical, lightweight animations that enhance usability

3. Develop basic visualization components:
   - Leverage the existing SVG icon library for form steps (already implemented)
   - Create a small library of essential energy-related SVG illustrations (house, heating systems)
   - Build simple responsive image components that adapt to different screen sizes
   - Design basic progress indicators with minimal visual feedback

4. Integrate with form system:
   - Connect visual content to form state changes
   - Implement basic visual feedback for form interactions (success, error states)
   - Create simple transitions between form sections with CSS
   - Ensure visual content enhances rather than distracts from form completion

5. Implement basic i18n support:
   - Add simple localization support for text elements within visualizations
   - Ensure visual elements work with text of varying lengths
   - Support basic right-to-left layout adjustments

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit testing:
   - Test basic visual content loading and rendering
   - Verify that transitions respect reduced motion preferences
   - Test simple localization of visual elements

2. Integration testing:
   - Verify visual content system integrates properly with the form system
   - Test that visual elements update correctly based on form state changes
   - Ensure visualizations display properly across different form sections

3. Basic performance checks:
   - Verify images load efficiently
   - Ensure the application remains responsive during transitions

4. Accessibility testing:
   - Verify transitions can be disabled via reduced motion settings
   - Test that visual content includes appropriate alt text
   - Ensure color contrast in essential visual elements

5. Cross-browser testing:
   - Test visualizations in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge
   - Verify basic mobile compatibility on iOS and Android devices

## 2. Implement Basic CSS Transitions [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1
### Description: Build a simple transition system using CSS that provides consistent visual feedback across the application with support for accessibility preferences.
### Details:
1. Create a small set of standard CSS transition presets (fade, slide)
2. Build simple React components that apply these transitions to content
3. Add support for reduced motion preferences using the prefers-reduced-motion media query
4. Create a few utility classes for common transition patterns
5. Focus on lightweight, performance-friendly transitions
6. Document usage patterns for the transition system

## 3. Develop Essential Energy-Related Visualization Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1, 25.2
### Description: Create a small library of energy-related SVG illustrations and simple visualization components for the form UI.
### Details:
1. Leverage the existing SVG icon library for form steps
2. Design and implement a few essential SVG illustrations (house, heating systems)
3. Create simple React components that wrap these SVGs
4. Build basic progress indicators
5. Ensure visualizations are responsive across device sizes
6. Focus on a small set of high-quality visuals rather than quantity

## 4. Integrate Visual Content with Form System [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1, 25.2, 25.3
### Description: Connect the visual content system with the form infrastructure to provide basic visual feedback based on form state.
### Details:
1. Create a simple bridge between form state and visual content using React hooks
2. Implement basic visual feedback components for form states (success, error)
3. Build simple transition components for moving between form sections
4. Create a basic mapping between form sections and relevant visualizations
5. Ensure all form-related visuals enhance rather than hinder form completion

## 5. Implement Basic Internationalization for Visual Content [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1, 25.3
### Description: Add simple support for internationalization in the visual content system, ensuring visual elements work with different languages.
### Details:
1. Extend the visual content system to support basic text elements within visualizations
2. Integrate with the application's i18n system
3. Create a simple mechanism for handling text of varying lengths
4. Implement basic RTL (right-to-left) support where necessary
5. Test visualizations with Finnish and English content

## 6. Create Responsive Image Components [pending]
### Dependencies: 25.1
### Description: Build simple responsive image components that adapt to different screen sizes and device types.
### Details:
1. Create a basic responsive image component
2. Implement simple image loading with appropriate sizing
3. Add support for basic image optimization
4. Ensure images display correctly across device sizes
5. Focus on practical implementation rather than complex features
