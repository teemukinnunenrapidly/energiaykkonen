# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement Modern Tesla-Style UI with Split-Screen Layout
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 3, 16, 25
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a clean, modern UI with a simple, responsive layout focusing on usability, performance, and good user experience while leveraging the shared schema and i18n setup provided by the foundational system.
# Details:
- Create a simple, responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes
- Develop clear visual separation between form sections
- Implement basic progress indicators and completion states
- Add simple CSS transitions for form interactions
- Focus on mobile-first responsive design principles
- Leverage existing shadcn/ui components for UI consistency
- Create clean, modern UI elements with good typography and spacing
- Optimize for mobile devices with touch-friendly interaction areas
- Implement responsive breakpoints at 640px, 768px, 1024px, and 1280px
- Add subtle visual feedback for form interactions
- Ensure all UI elements follow the established design system using shadcn/ui and Tailwind
- Implement basic loading states for form sections
- Integrate with the Unified Form System (Task 25) to consume form schema and i18n

2. Test responsive behavior across all breakpoints, ensuring proper adaptation on mobile
3. Validate that UI elements correctly display based on the i18n setup from the foundational system
4. Test the progress indicators by completing sections and verifying visual feedback
5. Verify smooth transitions when interacting with form elements
6. Test basic transitions for smoothness and performance
7. Perform accessibility testing to ensure the UI is navigable via keyboard and screen readers
8. Validate that the UI correctly integrates with the form system provided by Task 25
9. Test on low-end devices to ensure good performance
10. Test touch interactions on mobile devices to ensure proper responsiveness
11. Validate that the UI maintains visual consistency with the design system

**Performance Optimizations Implemented:**

1. **Code Splitting & Lazy Loading:**
   - Lazy loaded MultiStepForm component using React.lazy()
   - Lazy loaded step components (PropertyDetailsStep, CurrentHeatingStep, BasicInfoStep, ResultsStep)
   - Lazy loaded Next.js Image component for better performance
   - Added Suspense boundaries with loading skeletons

2. **Bundle Size Optimization:**
   - Implemented dynamic imports for heavy components
   - Added loading skeletons to prevent layout shifts
   - Optimized image loading with priority flags (only first 2 steps get eager loading)

3. **Performance Profiling & Bottlenecks Fixed:**
   - **Custom Keyboard Navigation Hook**: Extracted keyboard logic into reusable hook with proper debouncing
   - **Memoization**: Used useMemo for expensive calculations (stepData, progressPercentage, keyboardInstructions)
   - **Callback Optimization**: Used useCallback for event handlers to prevent unnecessary re-renders
   - **Intersection Observer**: Optimized section tracking with better threshold and rootMargin settings
   - **Debounced State Updates**: Added 150ms debounce for active section changes

4. **Focus on Usability Over Fancy Effects:**
   - Maintained smooth transitions but optimized their performance
   - Added proper loading states and fallbacks
   - Implemented progressive enhancement (keyboard navigation works without JavaScript)
   - Added proper ARIA labels and accessibility features

**Technical Improvements:**
- Custom hook for keyboard navigation with proper cleanup
- Memoized expensive calculations and UI components
- Optimized image loading strategy (eager for critical steps, lazy for others)
- Enhanced intersection observer configuration
- Proper error boundaries and loading states
- Reduced unnecessary re-renders through proper dependency arrays

**Performance Results:**
- Reduced initial bundle size through code splitting
- Improved keyboard navigation responsiveness
- Better memory management with proper cleanup
- Smoother scrolling and transitions
- Optimized image loading for better perceived performance

The calculator page now provides a Tesla-style UI experience with excellent performance characteristics, focusing on usability and accessibility while maintaining visual polish.
