# Task ID: 17
# Title: Implement Modern Tesla-Style UI with Split-Screen Layout
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 16
# Priority: high
# Description: Redesign the calculator UI to create a modern, Tesla-configurator-style experience with a 70/30 split-screen layout featuring visual support on the left and a scrollable form on the right, with progressive section unlocking and Finnish language throughout.
# Details:
- Restructure the application layout to implement a 70/30 split view (70% visualization, 30% form)
- Create a responsive grid system that maintains the split on desktop but adapts for mobile
- Implement 5 comprehensive form sections in Finnish:
  * Kiinteistön tiedot (Property details)
  * Nykyinen lämmitys (Current heating)
  * Lämmityskustannukset (Heating costs)
  * Säästölaskelma (Savings calculation)
  * Yhteystiedot (Contact information)
- Develop progressive section unlocking with visual indicators for completed/locked sections
- Add smooth scrolling behavior between sections using Intersection Observer API
- Implement dynamic visual content on the left panel that updates based on form selections
- Create Tesla-style animations and transitions:
  * Smooth section transitions with fade/slide effects
  * Progressive form field appearance
  * Visual feedback for user interactions
- Optimize the split layout for mobile devices:
  * Stack visualization on top, form below on smaller screens
  * Maintain smooth transitions between sections
  * Ensure touch-friendly interaction areas
- Implement responsive breakpoints at 640px, 768px, 1024px, and 1280px
- Add subtle micro-interactions and visual feedback for form interactions
- Ensure all UI elements follow the established design system using shadcn/ui and Tailwind
- Implement skeleton loading states for the visualization panel

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify the 70/30 split layout renders correctly on desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
2. Test responsive behavior across all breakpoints, ensuring proper stacking on mobile
3. Validate that all form sections display correctly in Finnish with proper translations
4. Test the progressive section unlocking by attempting to interact with locked sections
5. Verify smooth scrolling behavior when navigating between sections
6. Confirm that visual content updates appropriately based on form selections
7. Test all animations and transitions for smoothness and performance
8. Perform accessibility testing to ensure the new UI is navigable via keyboard and screen readers
9. Validate that form validation still works correctly within the new layout
10. Test on low-end devices to ensure animations don't cause performance issues
11. Verify that the visualization panel correctly represents the user's selections
12. Test touch interactions on mobile devices to ensure proper responsiveness
13. Validate that the UI maintains visual consistency with the design system

# Subtasks:
## 1. Implement 70/30 Split-Screen Layout and Responsive Grid System [pending]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Design and develop a split-screen layout with 70% visualization panel and 30% form panel, ensuring the grid system adapts responsively across desktop and mobile breakpoints.
### Details:
Use Tailwind CSS and shadcn/ui to create a grid that maintains the split on desktop and stacks panels vertically on mobile. Ensure breakpoints at 640px, 768px, 1024px, and 1280px.

## 2. Develop 3D Visualization Panel [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Create a dynamic visualization panel for the left side, supporting interactive and visually rich content that updates based on user input.
### Details:
Integrate 3D or animated visualizations using a suitable library (e.g., Three.js or SVG), ensuring smooth performance and visual clarity.

## 3. Build Scrollable Form with 5 Finnish Sections [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1
### Description: Implement a scrollable form on the right panel, divided into five comprehensive sections in Finnish: Kiinteistön tiedot, Nykyinen lämmitys, Lämmityskustannukset, Säästölaskelma, Yhteystiedot.
### Details:
Use React Hook Form and shadcn/ui components, ensuring proper translation and logical sectioning. Each section should be independently scrollable and accessible.

## 4. Implement Progressive Section Unlocking Logic [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.3
### Description: Develop logic to unlock form sections progressively, with visual indicators for completed and locked sections.
### Details:
Track completion status for each section and update UI indicators accordingly. Prevent access to locked sections until prerequisites are met.

## 5. Integrate Intersection Observer-Based Smooth Scrolling [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.3
### Description: Add smooth scrolling behavior between form sections using the Intersection Observer API for enhanced navigation and user experience.
### Details:
Implement automatic scroll transitions and highlight active sections as they enter the viewport.

## 6. Enable Dynamic Visual Content Updates Based on Form Selections [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.2, 17.3
### Description: Synchronize the visualization panel with form inputs so that visual content updates dynamically as users interact with the form.
### Details:
Establish state management to trigger visualization changes in real time based on form data.

## 7. Create Tesla-Style Animations and Transitions [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.3, 17.4
### Description: Implement smooth fade/slide transitions between sections, progressive form field appearance, and visual feedback for user interactions, emulating Tesla UI aesthetics.
### Details:
Use CSS transitions and animation libraries to achieve Tesla-style effects. Ensure animations are performant and non-intrusive.

## 8. Optimize Split Layout for Mobile and Touch Interaction [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.1, 17.7
### Description: Adapt the split-screen layout for mobile devices, stacking visualization above the form and ensuring touch-friendly interaction areas.
### Details:
Refactor layout for mobile breakpoints, enlarge touch targets, and maintain smooth transitions and usability.

## 9. Implement Accessibility and Keyboard Navigation [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.3, 17.7
### Description: Ensure all UI elements are accessible, with proper ARIA roles, keyboard navigation, and screen reader support.
### Details:
Audit UI for accessibility compliance and implement necessary enhancements for users with disabilities.

## 10. Add Skeleton Loading States and Micro-Interactions [pending]
### Dependencies: 17.2, 17.3
### Description: Implement skeleton loading states for the visualization panel and subtle micro-interactions for form elements to enhance perceived performance and user feedback.
### Details:
Use shadcn/ui and Tailwind to create skeleton loaders and micro-interactions such as button ripples and input highlights.
