   - Modify brand colors and verify they update in the preview
   - Change typography settings and confirm they apply correctly
   - Adjust spacing and layout controls and verify visual changes
4. Validate the live preview system:

   - Verify preview accurately represents the calculator
5. Test import/export features:

   - Verify settings are preserved during export/import
6. Verify logo upload functionality:

   - Confirm it appears correctly in the calculator
7. Test accessibility checker:
   - Verify contrast checker works with various color combinations
8. Test CSS variable generation:
