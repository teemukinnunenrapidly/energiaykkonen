Link Local Project to Vercel (Manual Dashboard Method)\nSince CLI linking requires interactive input, use Vercel Dashboard:\n- Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard\n- Select \"energiaykkonen-calculator\" project\n- Go to Settings > Git\n- Ensure this GitHub repo is connected\n\n#### 2. Add Custom Domain in Vercel Dashboard\n- In the \"energiaykkonen-calculator\" project dashboard\n- Go to \"Domains\" tab\n- Click \"Add\" button\n- Enter: `laskuri.energiaykkonen.fi`\n- Vercel will show required DNS configuration\n\n#### 3. Configure DNS at Domain Registrar\nOnce Vercel provides the CNAME details:\n- Access energiaykkonen.fi domain registrar DNS settings\n- Add CNAME record:\n  - Name: `laskuri`\n  - Type: CNAME\n  - Value: [Vercel-provided CNAME value]\n\n#### 4. Verification\n- Wait for DNS propagation (usually 5-60 minutes)\n- Test: `https://laskuri.energiaykkonen.fi`\n- Verify SSL certificate is automatically provisioned\n\n### Next Steps Required:\n1. Manual configuration in Vercel Dashboard to add the subdomain\n2. DNS configuration at the domain registrar\n3. Verification that the subdomain works\n\nThe technical setup is ready - now requires access to Vercel dashboard and domain registrar.\n</info added on 2025-08-24T18:14:58.981Z>\n<info added on 2025-08-24T18:16:20.268Z>\n## Status Update: Deferred for Manual Configuration\n\nTechnical preparation is complete. Task deferred pending manual access to:\n1. Vercel Dashboard - to add custom domain\n2. Domain Registrar - to configure DNS CNAME record\n\nAll research, analysis, and documentation (VERCEL_SUBDOMAIN_SETUP.md) is ready for when manual access becomes available.\n\n**Ready to Resume:** Follow the setup guide when access to Vercel dashboard and domain registrar is available.\n</info added on 2025-08-24T18:16:20.268Z>",
