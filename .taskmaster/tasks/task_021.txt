# Task ID: 21
# Title: Implement Form Builder Page with Visual Content System in Admin Panel
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 17, 18, 19, 25
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop a simplified admin panel feature enabling administrators to customize existing energy calculator forms with essential fields, properties, and dynamic shortcode integration from active calculations, focusing on practical form customization needs rather than complex enterprise features.
# Details:
1. Create a React-based simple form builder page in the admin panel, with a straightforward interface for field management and editing of field properties.
2. Implement field management for existing form field types: text, number, select, checkbox, and radio buttons with simple property editing.
3. Support simple validation rules including required fields, min/max length, min/max values, and basic regex patterns.
4. Enable administrators to edit field labels, placeholder text, help text, and validation error messages.
5. Implement section management to edit titles, descriptions, and show/hide entire sections.
6. Build a simple preview panel that shows how the form will appear to users.
7. Support basic responsive design considerations and accessibility (WCAG 2.1).
8. Provide form testing capabilities to verify form functionality.
9. Store form schemas in Supabase with basic validation.
10. Focus on editing existing form structure rather than building from scratch.
11. Implement save functionality with save changes button, reset to defaults button, and simple unsaved changes warning.
12. Leverage the Unified Form System (Task 25) for underlying form functionality, focusing on building a simple admin customization interface.
13. Integrate with Task 20 (Calculations) to display available calculation shortcodes for dynamic field content.
14. Enable dynamic field content using calculation results in labels, placeholders, help text, and error messages.
15. Implement real-time preview of how shortcodes render in form fields.
16. Provide easy insertion of shortcodes into form properties.
17. Add functionality to create new sections with a proper form interface.
18. Implement ability to create new fields within sections with field type selection.
19. Support all field types (text, number, select, checkbox, radio buttons, etc.) in the field creation process.
20. Create modal or inline forms for creating new sections and fields.
21. Develop an interface for setting up validation rules for newly created fields.

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify basic field management functionality: enable/disable fields, reorder fields with up/down arrows, mark fields as required/optional.
2. Test field editing capabilities: edit labels, placeholder text, help text, and validation error messages.
3. Validate simple validation rules: test required fields, min/max length, min/max values, and basic regex patterns.
4. Test section management: edit section titles and descriptions, show/hide entire sections.
5. Confirm preview functionality: ensure the preview panel accurately reflects the form being customized.
6. Test responsive design and basic accessibility: verify forms display properly on different screen sizes and meet basic accessibility requirements.
7. Validate form testing capabilities: complete test form submissions and verify data capture.
8. Test save functionality: verify save changes button, reset to defaults button, and unsaved changes warning work correctly.
9. Review Supabase schema: ensure form data is stored and retrievable as designed.
10. Test integration with the Unified Form System: verify that the admin builder correctly interfaces with the shared schema and visual infrastructure.
11. Test shortcode integration: verify available calculation shortcodes are displayed correctly.
12. Validate dynamic field content: ensure calculation results render properly in labels, placeholders, help text, and error messages.
13. Test real-time preview: confirm shortcodes render correctly in the preview panel.
14. Verify shortcode insertion: test the process of adding shortcodes to form properties.
15. Test new section creation: verify the interface allows creating new sections with proper form fields.
16. Test new field creation: confirm administrators can add new fields of all supported types within sections.
17. Validate field type selection: ensure all field types are available and properly configured when creating new fields.
18. Test section/field creation UI: verify modal or inline forms function correctly for creating new content.
19. Test validation rules setup: confirm the interface allows proper configuration of validation rules for new fields.
