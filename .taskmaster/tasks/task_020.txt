# Subtasks:
## 1. Design and Implement Calculations Page Route and Navigation [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Create a new route `/admin/calculations/page.tsx` and add a 'Calculations' tab in the admin navigation menu, ensuring the page is accessible from the admin sidebar.

</info added on 2025-08-25T08:59:50.584Z>
<info added on 2025-08-25T10:18:56.296Z>
Successfully implemented the comprehensive Calculations page with the following features:

**Database Schema**: Created Supabase migration for formulas table with proper RLS policies and indexes
**Type Definitions**: Implemented comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for formulas, validation, and execution
**Formula Service**: Built complete CRUD operations, validation, and execution engine with security measures
**UI Components**: Created professional admin interface using shadcn/ui components with three main tabs:
- Formulas: Create, edit, delete, and manage calculation formulas
- Templates: Pre-built energy calculation templates (Annual Savings, Payback Period, CO2 Reduction)
- Testing: Interactive formula testing with variable input and result validation

**Key Features**:
- Formula validation with error/warning detection
- Safe mathematical expression execution
- Template system for common energy calculations
- Professional UI with proper error handling
- Copy-to-clipboard functionality
- Status management (active/inactive)
- Version tracking and metadata

The page is now fully functional and accessible at /admin/calculations with a 200 status response.

<info added on 2025-08-25T10:22:56.731Z>
Simplified the Calculations page based on user feedback:

**Removed Templates System**: Eliminated the templates tab and all template-related functionality since they're not needed for the current implementation
**Simplified Formula Creation**: Kept only the essential form fields (name, description, formula_text, formula_type) without tags
**Streamlined UI**: Reduced from 3 tabs to 2 tabs (Formulas and Testing) for a cleaner, focused interface
**Core Functionality Maintained**: 
- Formula CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Formula validation and testing
- Professional shadcn/ui interface
- Database integration with Supabase

The page now focuses on the core formula management functionality without unnecessary complexity, making it ready for integration with the form builder when that feature is completed.
</info added on 2025-08-25T10:22:56.731Z>
<info added on 2025-08-25T10:23:26.815Z>
Final simplification completed based on user feedback:

**Removed Formula Type Dropdown**: Eliminated the formula type selection dropdown since it's not needed for the current implementation
**Streamlined Form Layout**: Changed from a 2-column grid layout to a single-column layout for better focus
**Simplified Form Fields**: Now only includes the essential fields:
- Formula Name (required)
- Description (optional)
- Formula Text (required, with validation)

The formula creation form is now much cleaner and focused on the core functionality needed. Users can create formulas by simply providing a name, description, and the mathematical formula text. The form automatically sets the formula_type to 'energy_calculation' as the default, eliminating unnecessary complexity.

The page maintains all core functionality while providing a streamlined user experience that aligns with the simplified requirements.
