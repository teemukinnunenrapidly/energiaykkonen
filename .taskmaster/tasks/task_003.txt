# Task ID: 3
# Title: Design Responsive Multi-Step Form UI
# Status: done
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement a mobile-first, multi-step form using shadcn/ui, React Hook Form, and Tailwind CSS, matching the PRD's UX and accessibility requirements.
# Details:
- Build four steps: House Info, Current Heating, Household, Contact Info.
- Use shadcn/ui components (Input, Select, Radio, ProgressBar, Button).
- Group related fields, use clear labels, and add placeholder/help text.
- Implement progress bar and back/next navigation.
- Ensure touch targets (min 44px), single-column mobile layout, and responsive breakpoints (640px, 768px, 1024px).
- Add accessibility attributes (aria-labels, focus states).
- Use Inter font and color palette from PRD.

# Test Strategy:
Test on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, iOS Safari, and Android Chrome. Validate accessibility with screen readers and keyboard navigation. Check responsiveness at all breakpoints.

# Subtasks:
